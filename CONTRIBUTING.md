# Contributing guidelines for this project

## Who can contribute
Anyone can contribute to this project regardless of what their exact relationship to it is, provided that you follow the recommendations outlined below and adhere to best practices for collaborative work (e.g., avoid ad hominen attacks, unnecessary criticism). Contributors do not necessarily need to have a/the solution to a problem or a feature request (so anyone who is a non-coder can contribute in some fashion), but they should be able to describe the purpose and need in sufficient detail.

## How to contribute
### Did you find a bug?
* Please check the existing [Issues](https://github.com/utlibraries/research-data-discovery/issues) and create a new one if you don't see something that covers what you found. Try to be as descriptive as possible (e.g., indicate which script or output file has a problem), list a possible solution or explanation if you have one, and any details that might be important (e.g., what version of Python you're using). Don't worry about labels; I can add those if you're unsure.
* If you are comfortable with forking and making pull requests, feel free to do so. I will endeavour to review PRs as soon as is possible, but I have a lot of other responsibilities, so it may not be possible to address non-critical bugs immediately. 
* If you are not comfortable with forking or PRs, feel free to just make an issue with details. Even if you only have a concept of a solution but not the concrete code to execute it, you should still create an issue.

### Do you have a suggestion or request?
* Please check the existing [Issues](https://github.com/utlibraries/research-data-discovery/issues) and create a new one if you don't see something that covers what you would like to see. This feature is used for future product development too, so what your issue is about does not need to be a 'problem' so to speak.
* If you are comfortable with forking and making pull requests, feel free to do so. I will endeavour to review PRs as soon as is possible, but I have a lot of other responsibilities, so it may not be possible to address non-critical suggestions/requests immediately. 
* If you are not comfortable with forking or PRs, feel free to just make an issue with details. Even if you only have a concept of a solution but not the concrete code to execute it, you should still create an issue.

### Coding conventions
I don't currently have a detailed list of coding conventions that *must* be adhered to. Try your best to mirror how I've written the code so far.

### Requests that will typically not be accepted
* Suggested changes or requested changes to the code that are strictly cosmetic (e.g., renaming variables, removing whitespace, standardizing every quotation mark) will not be accepted. If you think there is a good reason for making a cosmetic change (e.g., renaming a series of variables with confusing names), create an issue to start a discussion about it. Do not attempt to fold these into more substantive changes - this will make it harder and take longer to review the proposed changes.
* I am not some expert programmer, so there are probably many ways in which some of the code can be cleaned up to be more resource-efficient or in line with best practices - these are acceptable changes to make, but you should definitely create an issue and get a discussion going before attempting to propose these changes. Sometimes there actually is a reason for my unelegant code.
* If you have suggestions for the README documentation or this CONTRIBUTING document, feel free to create an issue and/or make PR for that.
